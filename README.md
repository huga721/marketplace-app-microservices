# 🚀 About the project
Marketplace is a project written in a Microservices architecture. The idea of the project is that users will be able to list products, buy them, and send messages to each other using web sockets. RabbitMQ will take care of the message queue, and buying items will use events to make products inactive. Project is secured with OAuth2 authorization using Keycloak.
